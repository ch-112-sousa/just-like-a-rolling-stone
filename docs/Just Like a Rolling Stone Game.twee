I worked as a programmer with more or less 18 years of experience in software development.
I understand that we, in the IT area, are more than machines!

Therefore, I have focused on the following items:

''Spirituality, Respect''
- Respect for Life
- I do care

''Trust''
- Name of my partner

''Teamwork, partnership''
- We are a team!

''Organization, rhythm, musicality, ethics''
- Just listen to me here
- Everything in its place
- Things in my time

''Changes, challenges, adaptability''
- For me it's fine
- Different from whatever

''Effort, fun, freedom''
- Good when you don't need it
- Better when I like it
- We don't need a reason
- You have to Want It!

''Simplicity''
- YES!
- That simple.
