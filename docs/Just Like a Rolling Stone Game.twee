I worked as a programmer with more or less 18 years of experience in software development.
I understand that we, in the IT area, are more than machines!

Therefore, I have focused on the following items:

''Spirituality, Respect''
- God exists
- I respect life
- I do care

''Trust''
- Name of my partner

''Teamwork, partnership''
- We are a team!

''Organization, rhythm, musicality, ethics''
- Just listen to this here
- Everything in its place
- Things in my time

''Changes, challenges, adaptability''
- For me it's fine!
- Different from whatever.

''Effort, fun, freedom''
- Good when you don't need it
- Better when I like it
- I don't need a reason
- You have to want it!

''Simplicity''
- Yes!
- That simple.
